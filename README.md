# AI_workshop_project
Repository created for the completion of an artificial intelligence workshop. The project was mainly based on working with the DeepProbLog (DPL) library. 
The repository consists of two main parts:
- "Comparison" - contains the necessary code and a Jupyter Notebook comparing the performance of neural networks trained with and without DeepProbLog for number recognition (MNIST set) depending on training set size.
- "Titanic" - prepares environment, and Titanic survivability dataset for further work with DeepProbLog (no proper .pl file).
